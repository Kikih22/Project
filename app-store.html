                <p>The app store was released in 2007 to allow users to have access to all sorts of different apps easily. 
                    The app store became named the app store because "app" is short for application. 
                    These applications enhance the users experience using the iphone and allow them to have extended access to the internet and world. 
                    The app store is an electronic market place that provides a safe and uniform way to purchase applications. 
                    The app store contains games, multimedia, and productivity. 
                    The app store also has a way to leave comments and reviews. 
                    This allows people to inform other people of certain pros and cons of the different applications. 
                    Most apps are made by their own individual creators and they are put out on the app store for other people to buy and use. 
                    The app store offers many free apps as well as apps available for purchase. 
                    The app store was added to the iOS software in the iOS 2.0 update. 
                    Apple making their AppStore led to the generic term “app store.” 
                    Apple did not come up with the idea of the app store; however, they trademarked the name “AppStore” after they adopted the software. 
                    In September, 2003 Danger Inc came out with an app store app called “Download Fun”. 
                    Nokia also came out with an app store called “Nokia Download”. 
                    Apple came out with the AppStore and brought in a lot of money even when the bugs weren’t fixed. 
                    The AppStore was a huge milestone in the iphone.
