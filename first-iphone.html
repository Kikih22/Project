                The first iphone was released on June 29th, 2007. 
                It was a ground-breaking creation that Steve Jobs brought to the world. 
                It was so influential that over six million units were sold.
                The development of the Iphone was kept secret until the release date and production started in 2005. 
                The iphone was the first touch-screen phone. 
                It eliminated the abundance of buttons and utilized screen size. 
                The man behind the iphone is Steve Jobs. 
                The project to create the iphone was called Project Purple 2. 
                The iphone was marketed at $499-$599 on the release date June 29th 2007. 
                Buying an iphone required a two year contract. 
                The back cover of the iphone was made up of aluminum. 
                The iphone had multi-touch technology that no other technology had. 
                The rear camera had a resolution of two megapixles and geotagging. 
                The iphone had four buttons: the power button, home button, volume up button, and volume down button. 
                The software the iphone used was called iphone OS 1. 
                The iphone eventually reached other countries. 
                In November 2007 units were sold to Germany, Britain, and France. 
                In March of 2008 units were sold to Australia, and then in April were sold in Canada. 
                In October the iphone was the fourth highest selling handset. 
                The iphone uses other hardware and software from other companies. 
                The iphone OS software also had several updates for the iphone 1st generation. 
                iOS 2 was release on july 11th, 2008 and iOS 3 was released on June 17th 2009.
