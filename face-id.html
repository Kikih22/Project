                <p>Face-id was created as a more secure way to protect contents on a person's phone. 
                    Face-id ensures that every iphone user's phone has complete privacy and protection. 
                    Face-id is also a quick way to unlock a phone. Face-id can be used to unlock a phone, access passwords, making payments and purchases, and securing apps. 
                    Face-id was released with the iPhone X in 2017. Face-id was integrated because it is more secure than fingerprint-id. 
                    Face-id works even with glasses, make-up, facial-hair, and masks. 
                    After taking out the home button in the iPhones before the iPhone X Apple needed to replace the easy security of the fingerprint recognition with face-id. 
                    Face-id uses infrared depth perception. Face-id became a large source of income. 
                    Face-id was game changing and prompted more people to upgrade to the new phones. 
                    Face-id did face some scrutiny because of the lack of security. 
                    People were worried that it would be easy to point the phone at someone’s face and unlock it. 
                    Face-id works with infrared dots projected on a person’s face to grasp the image to confirm the identity. 
                    The infrared dots are vast at a number of over 30,000 dots. 
                    The infrared dots are not from the camera. 
                    Apple has stated that face-id is 20x more secure than touch-id. 
                    1 in 1,000,000 people are able to unlock someone else’s phone with face-id. 
                    Meanwhile, 1 in 50,000 people who try to unlock an iphone secure with touch-id are successful. 
                    Touch-id was evolutionary and a huge step in the iPhone project.</p>
