                <p>Siri is an AI that Apple created to give users a more efficient way of getting information. 
                    She can answer yes and no questions, as well as provide information about various topics. 
                    Siri has many user commands that also provide the user with shortcuts to accomplish various tasks, such as checking the weather. 
                    Siri was made to be a digital assistant on the Apple OS softwares. 
                    Siri uses voice tracking, gesture based control, focus tracking, and natural language user interface to accommodate all of someone's needs. 
                    Siri was not an original idea from Apple. Siri was released in February of 2011.Siri was launched as an app at first. 
                    Later, Siri was put into the iPhone 4s on October 4th 2011, and it no longer needed an app. 
                    Integrating Siri into the OS update brought in more revenue, because it gave people a reason to update their phone. 
                    Siri can perform phone actions, provide information from the internet, tell you the weather, etc. 
                    Siri also has different voice settings. You can make Siri British, Australian, American, male, and female. 
                    The American voice was recorded in July 2005 by Susan Benette. 
                    She had no idea that her recording would be used for Siri when she made it. 
                    When Siri was released it received mixed reviews. 
                    Some said that it would not do as they told it to, but others said they loved it. 
                    Some people said the voice deciphering is really great and efficient; however it is not always consistent in understanding.</p>
